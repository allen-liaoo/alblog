Welcome to Allen's Corner of the World! This is where I share anything I find interesting, including topics like logic, paradoxes, functional or logic programming, proof assistants, and maybe some philosophy. 

You can reach me via [email](mailto://wcliaw610@gmail.com), or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/allen-liaoo).
